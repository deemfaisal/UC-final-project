CODED

Idea❔:

CODED is an application that has been built to have all the students of the programs of CODED's company. 

It is a user-based application, so it displays all the content related to the user from their program track, lectures, tasks, calendar, videos and etc. 

The main goal of the application is to save time and energy for the students to look up for their activity in the program, so they'll find ease and comfort in finding everything they need in only one application. It also gives them a wider picture through CODED's communituy, their upcoming programs, plans and events. A student can also share their ideas, upadtes and quotes through a dashboard that has been placed in the home page in the application and other features that the user could benefit from. 



Future Work ♻️:

Still needs to be added: Assigning roles. For example, giving the control to an admin user like an instructuor or a student mentor, so they could edit on the lectures, cw's, videos and etc. Also, a student who can only access not edit. 

A future look is that the application could have more animations, gifs and well-developed chat rooms, so again it becomes a lot easier for students to interact and reach the community through it.
